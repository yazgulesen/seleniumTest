    Handle multiple windows/tabs:

   In order for us to handle multiple windows we wil be using: getWindowHandle();
                                                               getWindowHandles();

   what is handle :
   is unique ID that holds the address of the window or tab
   It is approximately a 40 alphanumeric characters

   Synchronization and waits in selenium

   is the process of bringing the speed of two or more component the same level
   in this case we are bringing out script and page load to the same speed level

   Thread.sleep( )---- static wait/ unconditional wait

   1) Implicit wait
   2) Explicit wait
   3) Fluent wait

   1) Implicit----it tells the web-driver to wait for certain amount time before throwing an exception
      it will be written once and will be applied to the whole session
      we can say implicit wait is global wait
      so it continuously check until element is present for 20 seconds, if it will find in 10 seconds and left 20 seconds will be ignored
       -----it works with findElement() method----------
     if the element is not found it will wait until the time end then will throwException
