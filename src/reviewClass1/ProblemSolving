How to be a good programmer/tester.
The keypoint is to ACT like one.
Fixing a broken pipe:
If you need to fix a broken water pipe, you have to act like a plumber.
You won't just stand there watching the pipe throw water ,try to stop it with hands or a piece of tape. It just won't work.
You will  analyse the problem,the leaking pipe,
most probably you will replace the pipe.
How will you replace it??
Steps: goto the market and purchase a new pipe...
Use the wrench to open the previous one
Place the new one there and then use the wrench again to tighten it.
The same methodology  is applied when it comes to programming.
Be it any programming problem you have to approach it like a programmer.
E.g
You have to write a code that prints the odd numbers only.
Develop the approach first.
So a basic approach will be
1. Assign a odd value to a variable.
2. Print it
3. Add 2 in that value
4.print it
Ok so it works but now I want to do it till hundred so what  programming tool  can I use.
YOU GUESSED it right  the
 LOOPS
Once you have the technique  figured out, you just need to translate it into the programming language that you desire.
Keypoint: Always develop a rough methodology  of the problem that you are facing and then try to translate that method  into the programing language and use all the tools u have in your brain (edited)
