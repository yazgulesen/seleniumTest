   What is Selenium :
     --- set of tool which helps us automate testing web applications. It is mainly used to perform functional testing

     Selenium components;
     Selenium IDE-> integrated development environment
     Selenium Grid-> Firefox plugin
     Selenium WebDriver
     Selenium RC-> remote control

     What is selenium WebDriver?
       automation tool which allows us to test on web application
       it is an open source tool(means free)
       WebDriver is an Interface.

    Advantage of selenium WebDriver:
    -- Open source(free)
    --works with different browsers and supports cross browsing testing
    --works with different programming language
    --OS independent, it can work with iOS, windows, linux

    Disadvantages:
    -- you can not test desktop applications only web applications
    -- since it is free , no technical support
    -- no built in report(no feedback, no documentation)
    --we can not test images, videos or captures

   get()-- get method will wait for the page to fully load while navigate method will not, it will go to next
           not keeping history of the browser
   navigate()--navigate can gow back and forward, and refresh
               keeping history of the browser

   close()--will close the current tab
   quit() --will close whole browser

   fullscreen()-- maximize the whole application, cann'y use the tabs
   maxsimize()-- will be able to see the control
