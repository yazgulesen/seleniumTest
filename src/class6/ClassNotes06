Alerts:
Alert is a pop up message, alerts take a complete focus of our main page that we are working on.
 we can not proceed until it is handled.

    3 types of alerts:
 1) web based alerts/html alerts. Inspectable=HTML/ we can inspect and perform actions
 2) javascript alert/browser alerts- we can handle this alerts by using switchTo() method; we can not inspect
 3) window based alerts- we can not handle in Selenium, since it is webBased testing tool
    and windowBased alerts take you to another window

        Types of JavaScript alerts:
    1) simple alert- only one option /click ok
    1)confirmation alert/either cancel or click
    3) prompt alert-/ there is textBox/ enter the text or cancel

    To handle JS alerts we only have 4 methods:
        1) accept()/ click ok
        2) dismiss()/ cancel
        3) getText()/ will help get the text
        4) sendKeys()/ filling the text

  To handle authentication alert we need to pass username and password in the URL
      public static String url = "https://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth";
