How we Handle Calendars:

1) click on calendar so it expends/ we can see
2) know what month I am going /locate the month and get the text
3) if the desired text is not visible----> we will keep clicking on next and updating
4) as soon as we find our desired month ----->we will grab all the cells from the table
5) loop through the cells
6)once cell value is matched with our condition we will simply click matched date

in Selenium in order to take screeshots TakesScreenShot interface
