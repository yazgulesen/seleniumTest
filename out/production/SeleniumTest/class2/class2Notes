  What is the Web element?
  anything we see on webPage is considered to be Web Elements?
     example:    buttons, textBoxes,links

     HTMl?
     Hypertext markup language

     What is Dom-- stands for document object module.It is the browser's internal web page. also called dev tool for dev tools!
     Document----> can be stored any document such as pdf, excel..
     Object---->any line in html considered  as object
     Model---> it is just layout of html
     Selenium uses 8 locators to find the elements in the webpage
       -className
       -ID
       -linkText
       -partialLinkText
       -tagName
       -Xpath
       -Css selectors


       HTML Scripting Meaning:
       purple---tags/button, input, div
       brown--attributes,/ name, class, id/also selenium locators
       blue-->attribute value/
       <a -- means you have link in hTMl
       how to get link= <     >

       Why do we need many locators?
       -->developers might not provide all the locators for all elements
       --> some locators might not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
            for example : linkText and partialLinkText are only used for link only
       -->if 2 or more elements has same attributes or attribute values it will interact with first element it locates
